## Abstract
Diophantine equations play an important role in mathematics, since it is inserted in the universe of several academic levels, besides surpassing in sev- eral daily problems. This work was carried out to present to the students of Mathematics Olympiad what is a linear and nonlinear Diophantine equation, and its different forms of resolution, besides addressing historical contexts and demonstrations to assist teachers in the learning process. Firstly, to introduce relevant concepts of number theory, a theoretical introduction of the topics required throughout this work is carried out. Second, the linear diophantine equations are presented, and then an universe of nonlinear dio- phantine equations followed by resolution techniques. As a way to deepen the studies, there are several problems from other countries and from inter- national competitions of mathematics.
